Our project endeavored to create a music review website (similar to Rotten Tomatoes) that allowed users to view critic reviews of albums and rate and review those albums as well. Our first step was finding data to create a database that we could traverse with SQL. To do this, we downloaded two datasets of music reviews from Kaggle: one of reviews by Anthony Fantano (a prominent music reviewer on Youtube) and one of reviews from Metacritic. If we had had more time, we would have looked for other critic databases as well to aggregate into our project. These databases were combined imported into our albums.db as well as tables for the users and the reviews. The users table stores the information about the users who register on our webiste: their id, username, display name, and hash for the password. We also have fields for "saved album" and "savdd artist" because we intended to code a way for users to mark specific albums that they want to listen to. However, we didn't have time to implement this. The reviews table has fields for the album name, the artist, the user id of the user who submitte the reviw, and the review and rating for that album.
